# Seia-Soto/Clubhouse-API

The API wrapper for Clubhouse application (drop-in audio chat) based on online private API documentation and pwned sources by myself.

> **Warning**

> This API client comes without any warrenty.
> Also, using `master` branch is not recommended.

# Installation

To install this repository as your dependency, use following command with authorized git client:

```ash
yarn add git+https://github.com/Seia-Soto/clubhouse-api#[TAG]
```

# Usage

For working example, you can refer `/example` folder of this repository.
Also, about parameters for each API call functions, you need to inspect functions manually with notes that included with functions.

# Scripts

## `yarn example`

Runs example code.

## `yarn profile`

Create new prorfile JSON data by authenticating manually on command line shell.

# Reverse Engineering

To reverse engineer Clubhouse audio chat application, only thing we need is jailbroken device.
Because there is nothing else except for SSL certificate pinning and we can bypass it even on iOS 14 which is the latest release of iOS by installing some tweaks.

## Jailbreaking

> Use [Odyssey](https://theodyssey.dev/), if you're on iOS 13.6 or higher.

To jailbreak, I recommend you to use [Unc0ver](https://unc0ver.dev/) instead of others due to stability.
Setup AltServer on your PC or Mac and then install Unc0ver

### iOS 14

> You're not able to use checkm8 exploit if you're on iPhone 11 or higher (higher than A11).

If you're on iOS 14 or higher version, use [Checkra1n](https://checkra.in/) version 0.12.1 to jailbreak.
This this time, you need to disable your iPhone's passcode manually before jailbreaking.
Also, **DO NOT USE LATEST RELEASE** of checkra1n to avoid issue on A11.

### Post installation

If you install OpenSSH server to debug on remote PC, you need to **CHANGE BOTH `root` AND `mobile` USER'S PASSWORD**.

```ash
passwd root
passwd mobile
```

## Setting up MITM proxy

You can set up MITM proxy with following tools:

- [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler), [download directly (Windows)](https://telerik-fiddler.s3.amazonaws.com/fiddler/FiddlerSetup.exe).
- [MITM Proxy](https://mitmproxy.org/), [download directly (Windows)](https://snapshots.mitmproxy.org/6.0.2/mitmproxy-6.0.2-windows-installer.exe).

Install toolchains and follow steps to decrypt HTTPS traffics:

### Fiddler

You need to configure fiddler via [the official guide](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/Configure-Fiddler/Tasks/ConfigureForiOS).

### MITM Proxy

If you've setup MITM proxy, open `http://mitm.it` on your iPhone, then install certificate.

## Bypassing SSL Pinning

To inspect HTTP packet, there are ways to bypass it easily.

### ssl-kill-switch

Install required updates from Cydia for security reasons and install Filza File Manager or terminal emulator to install package file manually.
Open following repo and download latest release from it.
If you touch share button and then share the file to filza, you can directly install package file.

- [nabla/ssl-kill-switch2](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2)

After installation, turn it on in settings app.

### frida-ios-hook

Install iTunes and Python3 on your PC and open iTunes after install.
Connect to your iPhone shell via methods described in [Wireshark remote debugging](#wireshark-remote-debugging) section.
Clone following repository to some directory:

- [noobpk/frida-ios-hook](https://github.com/noobpk/frida-ios-hook)

After, all things are ready, run script via following command:

```cmd
python3 hook.py -n clubhouse -s frida-scripts\bypass-ssl-ios13.js
```

- The script also works on iOS 14.

## Wireshark remote debugging

By piping stream over SSH, you can also debug your iPhone's traffic with wireshark installed on PC.
Before doing this, install `OpenSSH` and `tcpdump` tweak on your iPhone and install Wireshark on your PC.

You may add following paths to system wide environment variable:

- `C:\Program Files\Wireshark`

After setting up `itunnel-mux` or `3uTools` from below, open new command line window and start debugging with built-in ssh on Windows 10.

```cmd
ssh root@localhost -p 2222 -l root tcpdump -s 0 -U -n -w - -i any not port 22 | wireshark -k -i -
```

### itunnel-mux

Download `itunnel_mux_rev71.zip` from following webpage and add it to path.
At this time, you should install iTunes and Apple Mobile Support before continuing.

- [Google Code Archive/iphonetunnel-usbmuxconnectbyport](https://code.google.com/archive/p/iphonetunnel-usbmuxconnectbyport/downloads)

Open it and start proxy after connecting iPhone.

```cmd
itunnel_mux --iport 22 --lport 22
```

### 3uTools

Also, you can do this easier with 3uTools which only available on Windows.
Download and install it to your PC and connect iPhone via USB.
Then you can go to `Toolbox` tab and click `Open SSH Tunnel` to open SSH port locally.

# API

About the API implemented in this project.
Only special things will be typed.

## Browser support

The code is also available for common web browser as this project doesn't contain any code that requires additional C code build.
However, there are many ban reports from web browser use, so if you want to use this on web browser, you should build proxy server.

## Voice support

> **Update 2021/02/21**
>
> Voice-related support will not present after today because it is PART OF AGORA, not CLUBHOUSE.

Actually, the capacity of voice support is already present in my repository since `src/api/joinChannel.js` method implemented.
However, there is not enough information to keep users safe from unexpected bans, and I couldn't say `You can use this to do Clubhouse!`.
Other unofficial repositories are already doing voice stuff with Agora SDK built for their language, but I couldn't say that is safe to use.
Because, commonly for who operating production service can see every users connecting to specific gateway and it is easy to detect what users are using if user didn't change any thing on official SDK.
In future, I am planning to port iOS's Agora voice SDK into Node.JS to reduce ban rate.
However, limitation of my iOS ecosystem knowledge, currently only official JavaScript SDK is available to use and there is a huge limitation, which requires web browser context.

For additional information about SDK, please refer:

- [AgoraWebSDK NG API Docs](https://agoraio-community.github.io/AgoraWebSDK-NG/api/en)

NG is Next Generation in Agora Ecosystem.*

### Electron applications

For Electron based applications, you can easily integrate Agora with my clubhouse-api package.
You can see the example that describes how to get RTM token stuff in `src/structures/voice.js`.

For additional information about Electron SDK, please refer:

- [AgoraIO/Electron-SDK](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Electron-SDK)

## `client.getStatic(url)`

`client.getStatic` method will return a `cross-fetch` agent which having essential headers to query static files.
For example, you can download profile picture safely by using this method.

```js
const download = url => {
  const fs = require('fs')

  const response = await app.getStatic(url)
  const stream = fs.createWriteStream('./avatar.png')

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    response.body.pipe(stream)
    response.body.on('error', reject)

    stream.on('finish', resolve)
  })
}
```

## `fetch` option overrides

To override `cross-fetch` option object, you need to provide re-usable object to `profile.fetchOptions`.

```js
const profile = {
  ...profiles.application.a434,
  ...profiles.locales.Korean,
  fetchOptions: {
    agent: ... // NOTE: For proxy stuff;
  }
}
```
